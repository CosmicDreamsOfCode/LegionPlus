## Installation
To install Legion+, you may choose to either download the latest pre-compiled release from [the releases page](https://github.com/r-ex/LegionPlus/releases/latest), or compile the source code for yourself using the provided Visual Studio Solution file (.sln)

Compilation is currently only supported on Windows due to some platform-specific libraries that are used required

#### Export Load Flags
When any load flag is used, your saved configuration is ignored and only the specified flags are used
When multiple load flags are used together, all specified types will be loaded

```
--loadmodels
--loadanimations
--loadimages
--loadmaterials
--loaduiimages
--loaddatatables
```

#### Other Flags
